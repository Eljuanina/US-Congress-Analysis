## Running geographical analysis
This code is part of the analysis of the US Congressional record. To perform this analysis you don't need to download anything, everything should be in the appropriate folders. The data for the map can be found in the "gpd_data" folder. You can just run the script "data_science_project_metadata" and it should automatically save the pictures in the "pictures_party_map" folder and the gif in the "gif" folder. The first part of the script is bades on the metadata of the speakers, and the second part is about the geographical data of the speakers.
